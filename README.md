# Notebooks and Data from Biomechanics of Animal Interactions
These notebooks were used within Goolge Colab at Harvey Mudd College
during Spring 2023. These computational labs focused on image processing
techniques and kinematic analysis of animal locomotion. 

May also contain other useful material for tutorials and teaching.
